    <h2>🔐 Do I need to create an account to use this site?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you need to register and log in to generate personalized diet and exercise plans. Your data is used only to create plans tailored to you.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2>💪 How are the exercise plans generated?</h2>
    <p>We use AI (OpenAI's GPT-3.5) to generate weekly exercise plans based on your age, weight, height, gender, and fitness goal. The plan is then stored and shown on your dashboard.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2>🥗 What about the diet plan?</h2>
    <p>The AI also generates a detailed 7-day meal plan based on your input, considering your fitness goal (weight loss, muscle gain, or general fitness).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2>🔄 Can I regenerate my plan?</h2>
    <p>Yes! If your goals change or you want a fresh routine, just fill out the form again, and your previous plan will be replaced with a new one.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2>📊 Can I track my progress?</h2>
